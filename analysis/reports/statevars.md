SV report
================

Maxima
------

The maximum statevars are 179 species and 9248 individuals. There are a total of 2587 sites (route-region combinations).

I've made a p-table for these statevars by subsetting the `masterp_tall.Rds` from `diazrenata/scadsanalysis`. It'd probably take a day or so to sample from scratch.
